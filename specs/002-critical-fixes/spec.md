# Critical Website Fixes - Remove Book Content & Fix Data

## Overview

Fix critical issues with the Bob's Turtle Tank website:
1. Remove book chapter content (not free - selling the book)
2. Fix CSV data processing to get ALL 164 entries
3. Fix broken game paths
4. Add Bob image gallery from 84 photos

## Problem Statement

**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Full book chapters exposed publicly (should be paid content)
- ❌ Only 91/164 CSV entries processed (missing 73 items)
- ❌ Bouncy Bounce game path broken

- `/content/chapters/` folder

### 2. Fix CSV Data Processing
**Current:** 91 items (29 characters, 25 artifacts, 37 locations)
**Target:** 164 items from complete CSV

**Issues:**

- Categories: Characters, Artifacts, Locations, Spaceship components, etc.

### 3. Fix Game Integration
**Bouncy Bounce:**
