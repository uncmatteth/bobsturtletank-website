Chapter 13: The Orchard of Evermore

As the blazing orb of the relentless sun finally dipped below the horizon, Matt and Bob continued their journey, the light fading from the vast desert sky. Reflecting on their recent departure from the village, where they had left behind echoes of laughter and the warmth of newfound camaraderie, they carried the village's spirit of hope and resilience with them into the stark landscape. The emerging stars above them whispered of continuity and promise, bridging their past adventures with the road ahead. Despite the harshness of the endless dunes stretching before them, each star seemed to echo the village's lanterns, a reminder that light and friendship could thrive even in the most desolate places. Their long road wound ever on, but the desert's harsh realm was slowly receding behind their tireless strides. Verdant lands still flourished beyond the wastes' harsh boundary, and sight of that celestial splendor confirmed they drew nearer with each measured footfall.

With backs to the fading desert night, the companions pressed on as pink-fingered dawn slowly banished the chilled darkness. As morning's warmth permeated the lingering night air, a subtle yet unmistakable shift became evident in their arid surroundings. The drifting dunes gradually gave way to packed earth sparsely blanketed in scrubby brush, tough wiry grasses, and tenacious lichen clinging to weathered boulders. The withered vegetation and parched soil whispered of hardship, yet also resilience and patient endurance - the first heralds of life slowly returning to reclaim this barren country.

Heartened, Matt and Bob quickened their pace. The shimmering curtain of desert heat dwindled behind them, replaced by a gentle breeze smelling faintly of rich loam and growing things. By midday the wasteland was but a hazy smudge on the southern horizon. All around the wayfarers now rose a rolling countryside of rust-colored bluffs and low hills blanketed in tenacious prairie grasses and enormous fields of wildflowers nodding their colorful heads to the playful wind. Their route led along the grassy banks of a chortling creek where yellow warblers flitted through the shady willow bows and fat trout hovered in the sparkling eddies. As the land grew ever more fertile and welcoming, Matt felt himself shedding the desert's lingering shadow from his spirit like a dried snakeskin crumbling away - the searing sun and parched drought fading into memory as soothing water and greenery flourished in abundance before him.  
It was on the seventh dawn since departing the arid wastes, as Matt paused to fill his water-skin in the burbling brook, that an enticing fragrance arose on the gentle prairie breeze - so subtle at first it teased the very edge of his sense, then growing ever stronger and clearer until the rich perfume permeated the sylvan air. Matt drew up short, nostrils flaring as he inhaled deeply, his weathered face creasing in a broad grin beneath his tawny beard.

"Well bless my soul, if that isn't the sweet promise of fruit ripe for the plucking!" the minstrel exclaimed. "I'd know that summery scent anywhere, though it's been many a season since my nose caught its like."

Bob tilted her wise emerald head, opaline eyes narrowed in consideration as she too tested the soft wind wafting through the gently swaying grasses.

"You have the right of it, my friend," the turtle concurred after a moment's assessment. "Those are fruits of field and orchard - tinged with the tart snap of berries and the mellow fullness of apples. We must be drawing nigh to some isolated garden left to run wild in this prairie country."

With his curiosity piqued, Matt quickened his stride along the faint track they followed, the tall grasses whispering around his marching boots. The land gradually swelled and rose before them into forested hills mantled in ancient stands of ironwood and vine-draped elder trees. As the companions crested a low hillock blanketed in emerald moss and cheerful oxeye blooms, a startling vista swam into view through the skeins of mist wreathing the high limbs - a vast sweeping clearing nestled between the forest's encircling arms, riotous with color and teeming plant life.

"Well slap my knee and call me a jackrabbit!" Matt exclaimed, scarcely trusting his eyes. "It's a whole blessed orchard out here in the middle of nowhere!"

Indeed, the sheltered vale cupped between the looming woodland ridges was utterly transformed from the dim, cool shadows of the surrounding forest. The sun streamed down in golden glory upon row after row of laden fruit trees in full summertime bounty, boughs groaning under the burden of glossy oranges, blushing pears, and apples so crimson they seemed fit to burst. Lush currant bushes crowded up to the margins of the trees, spilling over with dangling clusters of ripe berries. The very air thrummed with birdsong, trilling melodies cascading in joyful chorus from hundreds of tiny throats concealed amid the gently swaying greenery.

Brilliantly plumed orioles and indigo buntings flitted and chased between the laden branches, their metallic colors flashing like winged gems in the angled light. Bees and butterflies danced from bloom to heavy-headed bloom, filling the sultry air with their sleepy buzzing as they set about their work. The rich aromas seemed almost a physical force, suggesting endlessly varied tastes - sweet flickers of sugared honey, the tang of sun-warmed stone fruits, above all the glorious impossible ripeness promise of fruits harvested at the very height of their prime. To Matt's suddenly ravenous senses, it seemed a small corner of paradise itself, unlikely yet wondrous in its pastoral serenity.

"Well blessed stars above, but isn't this a treasure?" Matt mused as he gazed out over the sun-drenched vale. "I'd half believe we stumbled on the orchards of the fairies themselves!"

"One never knows in such a strange and lovely place," Bob agreed, craning her neck to take in the full expanse of the fruit-strewn hollow.

Eagerly the companions descended the grassy slope into the succulent embrace of the wild garden. As they passed between the first orderly ranks of trees, Matt plucked a blushing plum, its skin so taut and lustrous it seemed fit to burst. He bit deep, and his eyes rolled back in endorphin bliss as the sweet juices filled his mouth in ambrosial rush, perfuming the air around him with sun-warmed rapture.

"Saints be praised, but that's the real stuff!" Matt proclaimed joyfully around his mouthful. "Take a taste, Bob. I wager you never had the likes from any vendor's stall or larder shelf!"

Bob needed little urging. Her thick scaled neck shot forward quicker than an uncoiling snake, and her powerful jaws closed around a juicy peach nearly the size of her head. The turtle's eyes narrowed in unabashed delight, beads of nectar dripping down her jade-green chin as she chewed with unhurried relish. At last the fruit was reduced to a pulpy memory, and Bob smacked her lips with a contented sigh that seemed to resonate from her very shell.

"You speak only gospel truth, my friend," she declared. "Never have I sampled such ambrosia. Why, I feel my very bones tingling with renewed vigor from just one taste!"  
Thus began an endless round of plucking, munching, and slurping as Matt and Bob wandered farther into the emerald heart of the wild sanctuary. Many were the delights they sampled as the morning wore on - sweet cherries with flesh like edible rubies, tart cranberries that puckered the mouth in tart delight. Matt shimmied up the gnarled trunk of a generously laden apple tree, filling his pockets with fruit of varied hue and savor - sunny gold, blushed pink, deepest crimson. He tossed the ripest specimens down to Bob, who snapped them obligingly out of the air and set to work with single-minded purpose.

Pausing beneath the dappled shade of a young orange tree bowed nearly double with the burden of ripening fruit, Matt sank his teeth into soft, yielding flesh infused with sunshine. The sugary juices filled his mouth in ecstatic rush, eliciting a low moan of unabashed pleasure. He passed several more of the ripe globes down to his companion, feeling the sticky nectar run down his own chin and wrist as he ate with unashamed relish.

"Merciful stars, I don't know when I've tasted anything to equal these," the troubadour exclaimed. "Why, just one makes a man feel downright decadent!"

Bob merely grunted in wholehearted assent around her own mouthful, letting her bulging cheeks and trickling juice speak her agreement.

In this manner they feasted, sampling all manner of mellow apricots with flesh like edible sunlight, succulent pears, and tiny sweet strawberries dotting the grassy aisles between the trees like scattered rubies. Many were the fruits familiar to their well-traveled palates, yet others seemed exotic blossoms nurtured here alone in this singular hollow, their flavors and perfumes found nowhere else beneath the wide skies. With each new variety, a flood of sense memories washed over Matt's being, carrying him back through the long years to half-forgotten boyhood days and the simple, honest pleasures of youthâ€¦

Long summer afternoons spent sprawled beneath the dollapple trees on his family's modest acreage as the honeybees droned and grasshoppers sawed... the twist in his belly scaling the garden wall hand over hand to meet Josie, the freckled neighbor girl with laughing eyes and secret pockets bulging with her mama's gooseberries, strawberries, and raspberries saved just for their covert summertime rendezvous... the explosion of mingled sweetness and bursting seeds in his mouth from the first sun-warmed tomatoes plucked straight from the vine, still dusty with rich garden earth.

As Matt ambled on through the wild orchard sampling fruits both familiar and exotic, he was swept up in a nostalgic reverie, serenaded by birdsong and the murmuring breeze through the leaves. At his side Bob kept steady pace, her wise eyes softening in quiet contemplation. Though her kind measured the flow of seasons in centuries rather than years, still something in this pastoral oasis called to mind distant reflections from her own youth untold ages ago. The simple act of tasting summer's ripening essence distilled from seed to fruit never failed to stir the spirit.  
At length, stomachs pleasingly distended from their ongoing feast, the companions wandered to the heart of the sheltered hollow. There they came upon a ring of towering oak elms garlanded with wreaths of ivy and cheerful wood violets nodding at their mossy boles. In unspoken accord born from long leagues of companionship, Matt and Bob nestled together in the deep shade beneath the eldest tree, watching dust motes dance and swirl through slanting cathedral beams of buttery afternoon sunlight. Eyes shut, they let the dappled radiance pool over their faces, listening to the somnolent music of rustling leaves and the orchard's endless thrumming industry. Drowsy from their feast, the pair slipped into untroubled slumber as the lengthening shadows began to stretch and pool between the rows of laden trees.

When Matt blinked awake some time later, the world below the canopy was swimming in shades of molten bronze and amber as the sun sank toward the horizon. Blinking, he sat up and stretched his pleasantly weary limbs as the last trailing echoes of peaceful dreams melted away. Bob was already alert, gazing out over the sun-washed hollow as if beholding it for the first time.

"Truly this is a singular place, my friend," the turtle mused. Her voice was hushed as if in reverence before some ancient shrine. "I suspect few mortal souls have wandered here before us in many generations. It feels...old, and yet undimmed by the weight of the long years it has witnessed."

Matt nodded gravely as he too took in the framed vista of the shadow-dappled vale awash in the day's final glory.

"Aye, you speak true," he agreed after a thoughtful pause. "'Tis like we've happened upon a corner of the world left untouched by mortal fortunes or folly. A living memory of older, kinder days before the world beyond these boughs grew so wide and strange."

For a timeless interval they sat together in wordless communion, watching the tranquil orchard world cycle through its ancient rhythms as the blazing daystar vanished below the horizon in a spectacular conflagration of crimson and molten gold. Dusk enfolded the sheltered vale like the closing of sacred curtains, the ordinary world fading into myth and shadow. As the swelling night seeped up from the earth to overtake the ebbing glow, a profound peace held sway, broken only by the occasional stirring vole in the fallen leaves or the plaintive hoots of a waking owl.

At length Matt stirred again, rising to his feet with an air of solemn purpose. Reverently he unslung his weathered lute, caressing the inscribed runes and polished body with work-roughened hands.

"A place as fair and wise as this deserves a humble token of gratitude," Matt said quietly to his enduring companion. "Will you lend your voice to the growing song?"

"It would be the highest honor," Bob replied sincerely, lifting her own voice in sonorous accompaniment as Matt's fingertips began to dance and pluck, summoning forth the first tremulous notes.  
At first his plucking strings simply echoed and amplified the subtle voice of the wild garden itself - the rustling grass, the trickling spring, and groaning trees whispered secrets from the earth's dreaming heart. But gradually the music swelled, infused with the magical resonance of the orchard. Bob added her own vibrant harmonies, a deep thrumming that called to mind her kind's unhurried and patient wisdom learned over long, misty centuries spent reading nature's endless poem.

Matt wove all these disparate threads into his unfolding ballad - the eager buzzing life, the slow wheel of the seasons, above all the stillness at the heart of living things that abided no matter how furiously the surface changed. His soaring notes were imbued with the magic of the land itself, giving voice to the spirit of this forgotten corner through his flowing music. The ghostly echoes of long-ago dreamers and lost summers seemed to swirl through the melancholy melody.

When the last shivering refrain had faded into the listening night, a hallowed silence fell over the darkened hollow, even the chorus of insects and night birds hushed in reverence. At long last Matt sighed, opening eyes he could not recall closing. He gazed upward past the rustling leaves to the sea of glittering stars unveiled in full celestial majesty high above this sheltered world.

"This place is timeless," he whispered, his roughened voice full of wonder. "Long after we're gone, some echo of us will remain here. Our dreams still lingering in the earth and whispering boughs, like ghosts or guardian spirits."

"All who come here with open hearts leave some small portion of themselves behind," Bob agreed softly. "This orchard remembers all who sought solace and simplicity beneath its bows. Their presence endures as surely as the wheeling stars overhead. In that continuity lies a kind of immortality."

They spoke no more that night. Side by side beneath the fathomless void, turtle and troubadour kept a tranquil watch until pink-fingered dawn crept over the eastern treetops. The night birds gradually fell silent, forest and orchard slowly passing from dreaming back into waking life.

When golden morning at last spilled over the sheltered vale, Matt and Bob rose and gathered up their modest packs. With a final fond glance back across the sun-speckled greenery and laden boughs, they turned and retraced their path to the boundary of the ancient wood.

"Farewell, fair oasis," Matt murmured as the trees closed around them once more. "Your gifts shall nourish us long after your boughs pass from sight."

"May your roots run deep, and your songs ne'er fade," Bob added solemnly.

As the orchard dwindled behind them, already it seemed to their eyes not a place fixed to any earthly map but rather a corner of the spirit - distant yet near, ephemeral but eternal as long as its memory endured in living hearts.

Their long road wound beneath the emerald eaves of the Verdant Wood. But now Matt and Bob walked with lighter steps, their heads and bellies filled to brimming with summer's distillation. In the playful music of the forest birds, in the dappled splash of sunlight through the whispering boughs, they heard echoed songs and laughter from that timeless oasis where dreams were remembered and seasons held no sway. The weary world awaited down the winding trail, but they carried the orchard's refuge within them.

Their journey through the living, forgetting world was only just beginning, but already it felt less lonely knowing such enchanted havens yet lingered just off the beaten track. Like stars burning bright beyond the day's blue vault, places like the wild orchard waited patiently for travelers who passed with eyes and hearts open to nature's gentle magic.

Come storm or drought on the long road ahead, Matt and Bob would remember the taste of peace found beneath the trees heavy with fruit. That golden moment would nourish their spirits through all the unfolding miles and mysteries yet to come. The years might one day dim the troubadour's eyes and dull his lute strings, the turtle's emerald shell fade to gray...yet in their heart of hearts, the orchard would remain eternal as long as memory endure. That day is not today though. Today is just the beginning of the journeyâ€¦
