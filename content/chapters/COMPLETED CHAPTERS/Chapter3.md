Chapter 3: The Witch's Curse!

After parting ways with the cryptic elder Everwood, Matt and Bob made their way out of the mountains and back toward familiar lands. The farther they went from the misty peaks, the lighter Matt's spirits became. Everwood's ominous warnings still lingered in his thoughts, but seemed less foreboding surrounded by green forests and rolling farmlands.

As the pair reached the top of a hill, an expansive river valley opened up before them, the silver thread of water sparkling in the warm sunlight. Matt hesitated, struck by a sense of foreboding as he scanned the idyllic landscape. Looking ahead, a thin smudge of inky smoke rose above a distant hill on the far side of the valley. His jarringly sharp intake of breath drew Bob's attention. "What could it be now?" she asked. Uncle Matt pointed toward the ominous sign marring the verdant vista. "Trouble brewing, unless I miss my guess. We should investigate." Apprehension tempered their optimistic reverie as they hurried down the grassy slope toward the valley floor.

The smoke likely indicated a village in distress, perhaps beset by mundane raiders or bandits. However, their intuition needled him with deeper unease. He couldn't put his finger on it, but there was something almost unnatural about the smoke, and each new dawn of late seemed to bring word of some fresh misfortune or brewing crisis needing aid, as if a rising darkness tainted the very air.

Reaching the valley bottom as the sun sank low behind them, Matt paused and met Bob's gaze. "We'll make for that smoke first thing tomorrow. But tonight my friend, I believe we've earned some rest." As the companions prepared camp, a chorus of frogs and crickets rose around them. Matt managed a small fire and sparse meal for the pair, too distracted to fully relax into the pastoral peace of their surroundings.

The next morning, as they drew closer to the source of the inky smoke, an eerie atmosphere permeated the cool morning air. The usual lively sounds of a scene such as this;of gossiping villagers starting their day; doors opening and closing; children playing; chickens clucking; wagons creaking slowly down the rocky paths, none of the usual bit and pieces of daily life were to be found here.

No, in this village, only muffled whispers could be slightly overheard between the humble thatched cottages. Most windows and doors were shuttered tightly against the dawn, and no tendrils of smoke seemed to be actually rising from any of the chimneys that dotted across the hillside. The empty silence felt heavy with dread.

Apprehension rising in his chest, Matt flagged down a stooped older lady scurrying by with her head down, her gnarled hands wrapped tightly around a small bundle. At first she tried waving him off, glancing around nervously as if afraid of being spotted conversing with him.

But his polite, yet insistent questions gradually teased forth the troubling tale. Over the past three days, a mysterious sickness had struck the villagers of Willowdale bringing feverish dreams, confusion, and paralysis. Each day the blight had spread, inexorably infecting more victims in the close-knit community. Just last week it had claimed old Riga, the most skilled healer and wise-woman in the village, and with her death by the strange plague, none now remained in Willowdale with knowledge of the healing arts. Though this was no natural pox or ague that they faced. On her deathbed, in her final moments of delirious fever, Riga had uttered one lucid word before the end—a word that made Matt's heart sink like a stone as he grasped the grave stakes at play. The old woman looked around twice before whispering, "Witchcraft..."

They listened with growing dread as she relayed all that had befallen Willowdale. There were many more still sick, and the woman beseeched the pair for any knowledge that could help ease the suffering. Years ago, before Uncle Matt decided to travel the lands, he had learned to concoct a few simple remedies using wild plants and minerals, but nothing to combat a mystic hex fueled by evil. Bob's innate magical nature lent a faint glimmer of hope, for her voice held power still untested. But neither Matt nor Bob were mystical healers themselves. They had tarried in Willowdale only to rest and resupply for a fortnight, not expecting to become entangled in its fate. But how could Matt even consider abandoning these people to such wickedness knowing there was even a chance he could help? He turned to Bob and saw his own conflict mirrored in her wise eyes. But in silent communion, they both knew the choice was already made. Whatever came next, they would stand together and fight.

Calling a grimly sparse gathering of those villagers still hale, Matt and Bob learned more of the insidious curse's cruel toll. Those who fell under its effects lived on, but lay locked deeply in an unnatural feverish slumber. Their bodies grew weaker each day as the mind withered within whatever endless nightmare gripped them.

No mortal illness or plague Matt knew matched the sinister affliction now stalking Willowdale. If some dark spell fueled this plague, the caster could only be a notorious witch of great power, skilled in the black arts. Though none dared speak the name aloud, Matt read it clearly in the frightened eyes of those gathered before him: Jhilsara Farcaryn, the Mistress of the Night herself—a witch reputed to dwell in the darkest depths of the remote Cinder Woods. Few legends evoked more visceral terror in the region. If the nameless fear now cast over Willowdale did indeed stem from Jhilsara, the village's chances of fighting back seemed dire indeed.

With the stakes established, Matt and Bob took their leave to prepare what few defenses they could muster. That evening saw them standing together at the edge of the village, staring into the gloom beneath the trees.

They both understood that to have any hope of lifting the curse likely meant confronting the source, seeking out Jhilsara in her shadowy demesne and either defeating her, or bargaining for Willowdale's release. It was a dangerous path, with the odds stacked high against success.

The Cinder Woods lay half a day's journey northeast, an expanse of gnarled, ancient trees whose twisted branches clutched hungrily at the sky. Few ventured near the accursed forest, and fewer still returned who dared entering.

Both Bob and Matt had traveled widely in their wandering years, but forever avoided that place shunned by all in the countryside. Within it's darkness likely dwelled far worse than wolves or vipers; and at its putrid heart Jhilsara. To even hope to match her centuries-honed powers, would see them risk swift death, or damnation.

Bob and Matt stood shoulder to shoulder, readying themselves for the grim journey ahead. The rising moon silvered the empty barley fields stretching toward the shadowy tree line. Not knowing if he would live to see another sunset, Matt committed the pastoral view to memory. At last they turned wordlessly toward the northeast and began the trek toward the one slim hope that remained. Their lives were now gambled in a desperate play against the gathering darkness and the barely glimpsed true threat still coiled beneath it. Neither could clearly articulate why they stayed to make this doomed stand. However, winning even temporary freedom from Jhilsara's curse was the right choice, whatever the risk.

As the towering trees engulfed them, any lingering doubts were quashed by urgent purpose. Strange whispers echoed just at the edge of hearing, though nothing stirred within the impenetrable tangle of shadow and woody overgrowth—it felt as if the very darkness was watching their intrusion. Uncle Matt marked their path with small sigils, hoping these arcane symbols would allow them to track back the way they came if fate permitted their return. Each rustle of leaves or shifting shape in the murky periphery set their nerves on edge. Though anticipation of attack wound ever tighter, the only enemy they currently faced was the uncertainty about what lay ahead. Still they pressed on, the clinging gloom seeming to weigh heavier with every step. The farther they ventured into the gnarled depths, the stronger the compulsion grew to turn back whilst still able. But subsiding within them both was the unspoken fear that if Jhilsara prevailed here, her malice would not remain bound by the Cinder Wood's borders. This malevolent seed, left to spread its choking tendrils untrammeled, could threaten everything they held dear in this realm.

Suddenly, the trees ended at an impassable wall of shadowy blackness rearing up before them. Matt blinked in the gloom, willing his vision to pierce the veil. Bob's grip tightened down on his arm, claws digging painfully in reflex.

Before them stood a swirling shroud of opaque mist, tinged sickly green in the darkness, the source of the inky smoke they had seen days earlier. The unnatural fog billowed and flowed around the edges of some great clearing, masking all within.

Together they crept forward, Matt probing ahead blindly with his short sword. The mist clung to exposed skin and seemed to linger in the lungs, bearing a noxious medicinal stench undercut by something far fouler—the sickly sweet reek of decay. As they hesitantly breached the barrier, the choking fog thinned enough to reveal a dark and gnarled cottage crouched at the center of the clearing. Fetid tendrils of smoke oozed from holes in the mossy roof, twisting sinuously into the branches above. The packed dirt around the ramshackle hut radiated cold wrongness, the corpse-witch's dreaded demesne where power had sunk deep over years of dark deeds and even darker pacts. Matt shuddered as the sheer extent of Jhilsara's entrenched evil struck him with almost physical force. She had been allowed to fester unchecked in these lightless reaches for far too long, growing bloated on the suffering and nightmares of all touched by her twisting influence. But tonight would see justice brought to this fetid hollow at long last. He steeled himself with that blaze of conviction.

From the gloom, a high pitched cackle rose on the breeze, the deranged laughter sending dread lancing through their hearts. Inside her decrepit hut, the screech and clang of slammed metal signaled frenzied efforts at work. Jhilsara's attention remained consumed with vile brewing, gathering power corrupted to inflict harm. Pinned by her distraction, right now was the moment to strike most effectively! They slipped through the coiling mist surrounding Jhilsara's lair, pulses racing as they neared the ramshackle cottage at the center of the twisted hollow. Matt tightly gripped the glowing crystal pendant—their sole magical asset that perhaps held hope of matching the witch's ancient evil. Raising her voice, Bob began chanting a courageous melody using her innate mystical abilities. The lilting fey notes reverberated through the cramped interior as they crossed the threshold side-by-side.

Bob's surprising song, woven with turtle magic, began to disorient and entangle Jhilsara's crooked senses. Gripping the crystal with white knuckles, Matt unleashed its radiant fury directly at Jhilsara. Cleansing light erupted, scorching the interior of the hovel and eliciting cries of shock and rage. Snarling guttural curses, the witch whirled with preternatural speed and hurled jagged ebony energy at Matt in reprisal. He jumped aside on instinct, the spiteful blast barely missing his vulnerable form to gouge the packed earthen wall. Bob redoubled her melody, imbuing the magical notes with deep resonance. The supernatural song battered the witch from all sides, making her stumble.

Turning to face her, Jhilsara only cackled, baring rotten teeth filed to jagged points. With a casual wave of a gnarled claw, she dispelled Bob's courageous cantrip. Then, in cruel vengeance, the witch spat a harsh word in a foul tongue. Her twisted power assaulted Bob, smashing the stalwart turtle violently into the far wall. Matt's righteous anger flared hot at the witch's heartless cruelty towards his dearest friend. Recklessly he charged straight at Jhilsara, underestimating her quickness honed over centuries of wickedness. She deftly side-stepped his headlong rush, then whirled with viperish grace, shouting a hexing incantation before Matt could recover his balance.

Matt abruptly froze mid-stride, as ruthless eldritch bonds paralyzed his limbs and smothered his voice. Helpless, he struggled futilely against the insidious magical shackles. "Foolish boy!" Jhilsara hissed through rotted teeth, her gnarled hands wreathed in crackling umbral energies. "I shall grant you a swift oblivion!" Straining his every muscle beyond limits, Matt watched despairing as she molded the lethal curse, fire dancing between claw-like fingers. This appeared to be his end, unless saved by some miracle of intervention.

Then just as Jhilsara launched her writhing death-magic, Bob hurtled into her from the side with a defiant cry. The valiant turtle scarcely budged the witch, but her bold attack disrupted Jhilsara's focus on the fatal blast, sending it wide to explode a nearby shelf into cinders. Locked together, turtle and crone grappled furiously on the filthy floor. Bob's meager spells flickered desperately against Jhilsara's centuries-old evil. Rancid ancient claws raked Bob's shell, while her small but determined fists pummeled the witch upside the head the best she could manage. Their intense clash interrupted the witch's concentration, finally allowing the paralyzing enchantment shrouding Matt to waver and lapse.

Wasting not a single heartbeat, he seized his chance while Jhilsara remained engrossed, diving for the fallen crystal amidst the ongoing struggle. Scooping up the artifact, Matt channeled every last shred of his courage and willpower into it. Sensing the radiance rekindling, Jhilsara roughly battered Bob away and whirled to face Matt with inhuman quickness, her gnarled visage twisted in a ferocious snarl. With flawless timing he thrust the crystal directly at the witch, just as she fully turned, meeting her nightmare gaze without flinching. "Your twisted reign ends now and forever!" Matt shouted in bold defiance.

Incandescent crystalline fury erupted in response, scouring Jhilsara's tainted essence and withered physical form with unrelenting, purifying fire. She let loose an unearthly banshee wail, the frantic cry rising above even the keening emitted by the overwhelmed artifact. Strobing radiance illuminated her agony as the purging light reduced Jhilsara's corporeal body to smoking cinders. Her protracted, otherworldly death-scream reverberated through the decrepit hovel. Meanwhile, in the distance, the sinister plague on Willowdale dissolved along with its wellspring of enchantments. Justice had at last found Jhilsara in the deep hollow she mistakenly thought beyond reach.

Panting hard from exertion and nerves, Matt shuffled over to Bob the best he could, to help the battered turtle off the earthen floor. Yet taking a step forward, he felt only cold dead earth beneath his feet. Confused, he glanced down to see Bob's limp body lying there, her inner light extinguished. Jhilsara's death throes had claimed one final victim. Agony lanced through Matt as he collapsed to his knees next to his fallen friend. Bob had sacrificed herself so he could land the final purifying blow. His cry echoed through the still morning air in raw torment.

Jhilsara was vanquished, but at the most dire cost imaginable. Matt clutched Bob's broken shell tight, refusing to accept she was gone. She had selflessly faced the witch's vile evil, only to perish in the oblivion meant for Jhilsara. This twist of tragedy tore Matt's heart asunder. Of all who had stood bravely with him against the forces of evil in this world, sweet Bob's loss cut deepest by far. He seemed cursed to persist, while those most dear paid the ultimate price.

Kneeling in the smoldering ruins, Matt cradled Bob's limp body as bitter tears streamed down his cheeks. For many excruciating minutes he remained there, paralyzed in anguish, unable to release his cherished friend. Everwood's dire prophecy haunted him, that each new dawn seemed to bring some fresh darkness needing to be fought. Now, Matt dwelt in his own midnight of the soul, alone against gathering shadows. Yet gradually, desperate purpose took shape within his roiling grief. If any faint spark of Bob's indomitable spirit yet lingered in her broken shell, Matt would fan its guttering ember, or perish himself in the attempt.

Gently lifting Bob's body, Matt turned from the tainted clearing, letting instinct guide his feet through the moonlit trees. But Jhilsara's malevolence lingered, permeating the very air. Matt despaired of finding any blessed spot where the land's primal magic yet flowed untainted. They seemed adrift in a forsaken forest of death where hope itself dared not tread.

Then, a slow limping shuffle sounded behind them. Matt turned to behold the hunched figure of Everwood emerging from the shadows clutching his carved oaken staff. The ancient guardian's piercing eyes fell upon Bob's limp form as he nodded gravely. "Quickly, follow me." Everwood rasped, his voice a dry wind through leaves. The elder fey turned and hobbled deeper into the close-grown trees, bare feet soundless on the forest floor.

Hardly daring hope, Matt hastened after Everwood, Bob cradled protectively against his pounding heart. If any yet knew of untapped enchantment potent enough to revive her, it would be this timeless forest sentinel. Deeper, Everwood led them into hidden groves where the air hummed with emerald mystery. Great tangles of undergrowth enfolded the path. The hungry shadows were barely kept at bay by their guide's weathered staff, tracing intricate runes of light. More than once Matt sensed malevolent whispers trailing their passage, and was grateful when at last the forest opened up into serene moonlight. They had reached a secluded glade where a pool lay pristine, beneath the moon's soft gaze.

Its shimmering waters sang with powerful magic bound to the land itself welling up from deep places untouched by mortal affairs. Here dwelt still the primal essence of life, death, and rebirth.

At Everwood's gentle direction, Matt reverently knelt on the mossy bank and immersed Bob's broken form into those glimmering enchanted waters. Ripples etched intricate patterns outward as he channeled his remaining essence into one fervent wish… Bob's life to be restored.

Long torturous moments crept by with no response and despair's cold fingers reached once more for Matt's heart. But, Just as he began to withdraw his trembling hands from the pool, its surface blazed with sudden azure radiance, pure, and blinding.

Bob gasped, eyes flying open, as the mystic flare slowly subsided. "Uncle Matt?" she whispered hoarsely. Overwhelmed with joy and relief, he shouted her name, embracing his revived friend. By fate's grace, Bob The Magical Talking Turtle was alive!

After gathering their wits, the pair rose on unsteady feet to follow Everwood from that hallowed place. Matt's heart filled with building eagerness. Although Bob was still moving slowly, "at a turtle's pace," she was already looking stronger with every passing moment. Hardship and fell deeds still lay scattered in abundance upon the winding path ahead. Though, for this precious moment, hope shone anew through the terrors and snares lighting their way forward.

After gathering their wits, the pair turned to stumble from the resanctified clearing, now silent besides the churning mist. Leaning on each other for support, they navigated back through the dense maze of trees by seeking out Matt's guiding sigils. Exiting the grove, a solemn procession wound through hushed primordial trees as the forest bore witness. The eerie whispers had ceased. It seemed the gnarled sentinels accepted the judgment that had been enacted here.

Matt half-expected the forest itself to come to vivid life and celebrate Jhilsara's downfall, but the land yet kept its own inscrutable counsel, the shadows holding back their secrets for now. Dawn's first timid light was creeping over the fields, as the two staggered from the tight web of boughs back into open countryside. A new sun rose on Willowdale to greet its liberators, though they emerged deeply marked by the ordeal.

Reaching the village boundary they were mobbed by tearful thanks from the same faces who had regarded them with such hopelessness the evening before. The curse had lifted the instant Jhilsara fell, granting freedom from its torment. Though the road back to full strength would take time for those afflicted, all would recover fully now that the hex no longer fed on their vitality. Joy and renewed laughter spread swiftly through Willowdale as families were reunited.

Matt was pulled into grateful embraces, until embarrassment made him beg for breathing room. Catching a moment between the celebratory chaos, Matt knelt and gently examined Bob, now resting in Riga's hut, the new village infirmary. The raw gashes marring her shell and the haunted glint lingering in her eyes told a tale beyond wounds to the flesh. They had survived, but not emerged unscathed. Hard lessons and harder choices had granted deliverance, but at a sore cost not to be paid in simple blood or pain.

A reckoning of price lay ahead on the road, but not this day. For now, there was warmth, light and community. With a revived appreciation for things once taken for granted, the witch's curse was ended, and both emerged wiser for the trial. Although left unspoken, it seemed that Jhilsara could not have been more than a servant or vassal. Her petty malice paled beside true powers that moved from high places reshaping the world incrementally to fit their own designs. Greater, and more terrible confrontations could possibly still lay far ahead on the road. But come as they would, Uncle Matt and Bob The Magical Talking Turtle would stand together to meet them when the time arrived. In the here and now, two battle-weary travelers reveled in the warm camaraderie, and took solace in a glow of connection, as their true journey was only just beginning...
