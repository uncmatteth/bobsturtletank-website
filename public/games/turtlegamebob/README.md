# 🐢 Bob's Roguelike - Fresh Start

## Current Status: Asset Review Phase

All previous code has been deleted. Starting completely fresh!

### What's Here:
- **sprite-viewer.html** - Interactive viewer to review all sprites
- **assets/** - All PixelLab sprites and game assets
- **Assets backed up** in `../temp_assets_backup/` just in case

### What Was Deleted:
- 15+ "complete" HTML game files
- 17,000+ lines of over-engineered code
- Multiple TypeScript implementations
- Phaser 3 framework setup
- All the "enterprise-grade" complexity

### Next Steps:

1. **Review Assets** (YOU ARE HERE)
   - Open `sprite-viewer.html` in browser
   - Check all sprites: Green Turtle, Enemies, Items, Effects, Environment, UI
   - Decide what to keep and what to trash

2. **Create Simple Roguelike**
   - ONE simple HTML file with embedded JavaScript
   - Use rot.js or similar simple roguelike library
   - Focus on: movement, combat, items, procedural levels
   - Keep it under 1000 lines
   - Make it FUN, not "enterprise-grade"

3. **Integrate with Website**
   - Link from /games/roguelike page
   - Make sure it actually works
   - No redirects, no complexity

### View Your Sprites:
Just navigate to:
`http://localhost:3000/games/turtlegamebob/sprite-viewer.html`

Or directly from the Next.js site:
`/games/roguelike` → redirects to sprite viewer

---

**Philosophy for the Rewrite:**
- Simple is better than complex
- Working is better than perfect
- Fun is better than features
- 500 lines that work > 17,000 lines that don't
