🐢 FROM BOB THE TURTLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"Uncle Matt and I went to 91 different places! From my cozy tank
in Cedar Hollow all the way to the Cosmic Void and back! Now you
can see EXACTLY where we went, in beautiful 16×16 pixel art!

The world map shows our whole journey - we started in the middle
(Cedar Hollow, Chapter 1) and spiraled outward, getting into
crazier and crazier adventures!

Pretty impressive for a turtle, if I do say so myself! 🐢"
