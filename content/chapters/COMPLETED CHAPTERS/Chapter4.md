Chapter 4: A Vision of the Future

The morning sun shone with blinding brightness as Uncle Matt and Bob The Magical Talking Turtle broke camp. Eager were they to resume the winding journey through the mountain pass ahead. As dawn illuminated the way forward, it revealed a maze made of towering stone columns and arches - all carved by centuries of wind and rain. Consulting Bob's map, it revealed they were nearing the Passage of Ages, ancient pillars rumored to possess strange enchantments. As they walked onward, the very air around them hummed with dormant power. Yes, this place still held secrets ready to be shared. The carved columns flanking their path were adorned with intricate runes and glyphs, their meanings lost long ago to the tides of time. Idly, Matt traced the symbols with his fingers as they passed, wondering what forgotten tales these silent sentinels could share if given voice. Calls of birds echoed oddly between the pillars, distorted by invisible currents in the air. Looking to the crystal amulet Matt wore offered no clues, its surface dim and unrevealing. But, he could not shake the growing feeling that great forces lay poised beneath the still surface in this forgotten valley.

By midday, Matt and Bob reached a circle of seven towering columns surrounding a raised stone dais. The monolithic pillars were carved from base to top with fantastical creatures and arcane symbols of power, pulsing with energy that attuned to forces beyond their world. As Matt slowly circled the dais studying the intricate stonework and glyphs, he failed to notice Bob climbing the weathered stairs. "Uncle Matt!!! You must see this!" her excited shout spun him around. Joining her atop the dais, he saw her gesturing at the massive central rune carved into the stone surface—easily thrice his height and flanked by ancient incantations in a long-forgotten tongue. Powerful magic permeated every line and curve of the ritual circle before them, an artifact unlike any other encountered on their journey, crafted by masters forgotten in the mists of time. Even gazing at its symbols made them feel they were playing a dangerous game. Caught up in fascination, neither wanderer noticed the crystal amulet now pulsing with inner fire in response to the dais' power. As they peered at the runes, a blinding arc of energy erupted from the amulet into the central zone of the portal glyph. With a silent concussion of light, Matt and Bob were flung into the luminous vortex, spinning violently through strange dimensions outside normal reckoning until they were abruptly hurled down onto the unyielding pavement in broad daylight.

Blinking away momentary dizziness, Matt gaped in wonder at the towering futuristic city. It surrounded them on all sides. Sleek metallic vehicles zoomed through the air on designated lanes between impossibly tall crystalline towers. The walkways were crowded with humans mingling with all manner of fantastic creatures, bestial minds walking upright and conversing with men. Matt could only stare in astonishment. This magnificent vision could only be, the future? Bob too seemed overwhelmed but quickly regained composure. She cautioned Matt they may have very little time before the portal's effects wore off, and possibly snatch them back. They should learn all they could of this astonishing era in the hours granted them. Matt nodded excitedly, and they set off together through the teeming streets. Everywhere, technology enabled marvels beyond imagination, healing machines, artificial intelligences, ubiquitous electric lights;a dazzling bazaar offered clothing styles unrecognizable yet beautiful. Their own drab and dusty attire drew many curious looks. Though foreign, none showed hostility to the visitors from the past. Indeed, vendors competed for their business, offering tantalizing wares in exchange for scattered coins from Matt's pouch. Over delicious synthetic foods and fizzy electric drinks, the pair discussed all they had seen of this exciting experience. But pressed for time, they reluctantly concluded it was best not to linger too long. Their true quest still awaited back in their own era. Perhaps someday they would return and explore the future in greater depth; this breathtaking glimpse would have to suffice for now.

The crystalline amulet suddenly began to shine again as the two temporary time travelers were pulled back to their proper page in the anthology of the Adventure Realm. Still reeling from all they had witnessed, the advanced date had seemed so peaceful, so prosperous. Apparently, humanity found its path to a bright future. But, had the road been smooth or hard between their age, and this dazzling tomorrow? No way to know except by moving forward along their own timestream. After glimpsing such wonders, Matt and Bob walked on with fresh hope for the destiny awaiting people in ages yet to come. Their roundabout path went on through the Passage of Ages as the sun began sinking, shadows growing strangely murky, unnatural flecks swirling just at the edge of vision. An ominous shiver crawled up Matt's spine entirely unrelated to the fading light. Glancing back repeatedly, he scrutinized the ever-bleaker gloom, quickly encroaching behind them, but could discern no movement. Still, the sense of being stalked grew overpowering. The crystal amulet had been quiescent since powering the portal, but now it sparked back to life with a crimson warning glare. "Get ready, I think we have unfriendly company incoming," Matt whispered to Bob. Back to back they stood, waiting as heavy footsteps slowly sounded, accompanied by metallic clanking. Through the darkness lumbered a hulking robot wielding a cruelly spiked cudgel. Glowing red optics focused on the pair as it hefted the massive weapon. More clanking heralded spider-like robots skittering out to surround them. "Intruders detected in Sector 17. Surrender and submit for processing." droned the lead automaton in a grating monotone.

Matt drew his worn short sword with practiced grace. "I think you'll find we're not so easily captured my metal friend." Baring his teeth in a fierce grin, he leapt forward with a yell, ducking the robot's cumbersome swing and carving a long gash down its torso that exposed shorted wires and leaking oil. Before the wheezing robot could recover, Bob sang a melodic note that sent visible vibrations shimmering through the air, toppling the smaller spider machines and leaving them overturned and scrambling to right themselves. Within moments, the battle was over, all of their attackers now inert and broken. Matt frowned with concern at the defeated bots, such advanced constructs could only have come from the future city. Their origin did not bode well for the era's destiny.

Pressing on with weapons readied, Matt and Bob soon reached the rocky pass summit overlooking a sprawling high-tech complex of factories and foundries. Thick smoke billowed from its towers while wheeled transport containers carried raw materials inside its fortified perimeter. Though, foreboding in aspect, no visible guards or patrols were present. Skirting the complex, another hour's march brought them clear of the Passage of Ages. Glancing back over a shoulder, the air began to shimmer hazily, the path they had taken disappearing into the darkness of the night. Both breathed easier once the oppressive citadel was lost from view.

Later, after making camp, Matt began thinking aloud about their current predicament. The future city had seemed bright on the surface but concealed dark forces controlling both machines and citizens from the shadows. Their portal must have accessed an illusory facade, not the full reality. They had witnessed but one potential strand of time—an insidious domination masked by technological splendor. Fortune had granted them clarity of truth and hope. Armed with knowledge, Matt and Bob could now act to avoid that sinister timeline back in their own era. A truly virtuous future awaited if they had the courage to see past illusions and shape fate through moral choices, not through blind trust in those who claim control solely in the name of progress. With this wisdom point gained, the pair slept soundly beneath the open stars, ready to resume their rightful quest with eyes unclouded by fate's tempting mirages. The future appeared to be still unwritten.

The next day's travel led into increasingly wild territory. Gone were any traces of the advanced civilization. Rugged peaks loomed as the pair picked their way through treacherous mountain passes. At times, only a narrow rocky trail skirted sheer cliffs with dizzying drops. Slow progress left tempers short as they began to doubt the vague trail they were following truly led anywhere. Perhaps it was time to turn back and seek an easier road, if one even existed.

Lost in thoughts, Matt failed to note the sudden icy chill pervading the defile until Bob shouted a harsh warning. With a start, he barely made out a faint spectral shape gliding toward them, indistinct in the gloom. Yet, its malevolent intent was growing increasingly and overwhelmingly palpable. As it neared, the amulet flared with searing intensity. Matt shouted defiance at the wraith while brandishing the talisman. Halting from the radiant power of the crystal, the spirit wavered in confusion at the yell before emitting an unearthly wail in return and dissolving into wisps of darkness. Seizing the momentary advantage, Bob grabbed Matt's arm pulling him along as they sprinted down the shadowed canyon, more cries echoing behind as shades emerged in pursuit.

Fortunately, the spectral entities seemed unable to endure the sunlight penetrating the canyon's exit. Bursting out onto an open mountainside, Matt and Bob left the ominous sounds behind. Though breathless, they dared not pause, lest the wraiths overtake them. After an hour of reckless descent along the exposed mountain face, the spirits' presence began to fade. In a sheltered hollow, Matt and Bob finally halted to assess this new threat. Between panting breaths, Bob shared her suspicions: The dark forces permeating the future city must have spread corruption into the spirit realms as well, twisting benign ghosts into evil phantasms. The shadows hinted of a growing danger coalescing just beyond the veil. Its true nature was yet hidden, but an implacable malice was reaching ever further. If they were to have any hope of succeeding in their quest, Matt and Bob knew they must find allies capable of standing against this tide of darkness. But where to search for such aid remained unclear. Ancient legends did tell of wise sages in secluded temples who had mastery over spirits, good and evil. If any yet kept to that sheltered path, they might provide the needed knowledge to overcome the spreading shadow. It was their best course available, though still a desperate gamble, if they could ever find their way safely out of their current situation.

Grim yet resolute, Matt and Bob marched on through the increasing gloom. Strange whispers rode the wind and unnatural eyes gleamed from thickets as the sun slowly sank. Dark things were gathering in force, but Matt and Bob were not without power of their own. Plus, they had on their side the one thing their faceless foe seemed to lack: courage, purpose, and hope. Perils aplenty lay ahead, but while life remained, they would fight on. At nightfall they reached a sheer rock face and could go no further. They set camp with the cliff at their backs, hoping it would guard against any surprise attacks. Taking turns at watch, they passed the night tensely. Whenever the fire burned low, unnerving sounds echoed from the surrounding murk. But nothing visible approached the camp through the night, and dawn's light was the most welcoming sight, finally banishing the oppressive shadows.

Setting forth with renewed vigor, Matt led the way along the canyon's edge seeking any passage forward. By late morning they reached a narrow crevasse cutting through the rock, the sole potential onward path. But at the gorge entrance lay a gruesome warning—a pile of gnawed skeletal remains from less fortunate travelers. Matt hesitated, loath to go nearer, until a distant cry of anguish carried on the wind, undoubtedly human rather than unnatural. Someone yet lived in the midst of these badlands who needed aid. Instinctively, Uncle Matt drew his sword and before Bob could get a word in edgewise, he stepped recklessly into the gloom. She rubbed her temples as she shook her head. "I don't know what I expected," she silently said to herself, smiling as she followed along without protest.

The winding gorge echoed eerily with their footfalls, though it was already too late when Matt felt the amulet grow warm in warning. From hollows and side passages, slunk beings that seemed molded of living shadow. Eyes burned blood-red as the darkness closed in around Matt and Bob. Creatures were on all sides regarding the pair with predatory hunger. "Well Bob, looks like I walked us right into a trap," Matt murmured. "Any ideas for getting out of this mess?" "Just one," Bob replied calmly, "I think I just had a thought about something neat."

Closing her eyes, she began to hum a resonant tone that swelled in volume and intensity. The melody pierced the gloom, growing ever louder until the canyon quaked with sonic vibrations. Cracks split the rock walls and boulders tumbled from on high, causing the shadow beings to recoil with shrieks of fury, blurring and dissolving as the overpowering tones blasted them apart. Only once the way ahead cleared did Bob let the note fade, and a shocked silence remained in the music's wake. "Remind me never to argue with you," Matt chuckled. Bob flashed a large, bright smile, winked, and turned to head onward. Picking their way over now freshly crushed rubble, the pair hurried on before the shadows could regroup.

Leaving the mist-shrouded mountain pass behind them, Matt and Bob continued onward invigorated by the dawn's radiant light after days spent wandering those gloomy peaks. Their path now wound down through moss-blanketed forests filled with massive evergreens, the earthy scent of pine needles underfoot mingling with fragrant wildflowers wet with dew. Few other travelers walked these wooded backways far from the well-trodden roads. Adventure lurked around every bend, ripe for the taking if one had the courage to seek it. Not to mention, unraveling the mysteries of the natural world was a siren song neither Matt nor Bob could resist following, both being born explorers in their true hearts.

For a fortnight they made their way beneath the leafy green canopy, drinking in the sylvan beauty and bounty. On short rests, when not admiring a hidden glen or secluded waterfall, their time was spent honing survival skills, telling stories, and reminiscing about adventures past. Matt taught Bob rudimentary woodcraft, how to snare rabbits, find edible tubers, and spot medicinal herbs. In turn, Bob showed Matt how to weave small talismans from vines and feathers, each imbued with a smidgen of protective turtle magic and insight drawn from Bob's musical nature. They kept spirits high by reminiscing about exploits from earlier travels, recalling witty quips, or moments of nature's beauty with fondness.

Days of travel later the forest started to thin giving way to sandy dunes dotted with tough grass. Upon cresting the tallest hill, Matt and Bob saw before them the vast shimmering expanse of the ocean, its waters shifting from azure to deep cobalt beneath scudding clouds. Bob's eyes lit up with joy at the sight, for she dearly loved to sail and had fond memories of voyages past, a long time passed, when she and Matt had first met, while each were following their individual destinies to explore the wide world.

They hurried down the dunes to stand upon the shore where foamy breakers lapped at their feet. Breathing deep the salty air, Matt too felt a resurgence of that old wanderlust. He gazed out at the seemingly endless blue horizon, imagining what undiscovered wonders it might hold. Somewhere beyond that watery veil could lay their next adventure, of that, he was certain.

Matt smiled to himself, remembering vague rumors and tavern tales of a fabulous lost city and its temples deep beneath the ocean waves, home to wise turtle sages of ancient lore. He had filed such fantastic stories under fiction in his mind. Yet, looking at Bob's beaming face while she frolicked in the surf, and watching her power grow exponentially as of late, he now wondered if there might be truth hidden in those legends. If any could locate that mythical sunken city, it was Bob, a turtle of uncommon spirit and perception. Perhaps hidden knowledge yet lingered in forgotten depths to aid their unfolding quest. It was worth pursuing at the very least, and either way, it would be an adventure. Their journey ahead remained unclear, but the ocean called to them both.

After consulting some local sailors and merchants, they secured passage aboard The Emerald Gannet, a trade ship bound for lands across the sea. The captain, an affable halfling named Runa, assured Matt she knew every current and eddy like the back of her hand. Her crew seemed equally seasoned, even though, a bit eccentric. They welcomed the travelers with jovial banter, evidently unconcerned about having a magical talking turtle as shipmate. As The Emerald Gannet unfurled her sails and set forth into open waters, Matt joined Bob at the prow, savoring the sea spray on his face. The first days of sailing passed pleasantly under clear blue skies. The two took shifts gazing eagerly over the rails, hoping to spot some telltale sign of the underwater city, though the fathomless depths remained obscured. The sailors spun yarns to pass the time, telling tales of sea monsters, haunted shipwrecks, and dreamlike islands that appeared and vanished with the mist. Then on the fifth day, stormy clouds rolled in, and the mood on deck grew tense. The winds picked up, churning the sea into frothing swells that battered the nimble ship. As lightning split the sky and rains lashed down, the crew scrambled to secure cargo and sails while the ship's wizard erected protective wards. Captain Runa shouted orders from the helm, struggling to keep them on course as towering waves crashed over the deck. While the crew took shelter below deck, Matt and Bob remained topside clinging tightly to the railings. Neither storm nor sea monster would shake their resolve. Peering into the roiling darkness, they kept watch for any sign of their elusive goal. Then, with no warning, the ship suddenly lurched hard to starboard. A deafening screech filled the air as a gigantic tentacle burst from the sea to coil onto the deck! More limbs smashed across the ship, splintering masts and railings as the crew poured forth screaming in terror. The infamous kraken had found them.

Uncle Matt drew his trusty short sword, bellowing with defiant zeal as he leaped into the chaos to hack at the writhing appendages. Beside him, Bob slid unnoticed into the fray, choosing stealth and cunning over frontal attacks. As he severed any tentacles he could find, she sang a disorienting melody that slowed the beast's ceaseless assault. Wave after crushing wave slammed into the beleaguered vessel, threatening to swamp it entirely. The kraken's reflexes remained dulled by Bob's song, but that caused it to grow ever more enraged, smashing blindly in all directions. Matt's arms burned with fatigue, yet still he slashed onward.

As he leapt to sever a tentacle latched onto the helm, the ship canted sideways, flinging him overboard into the churning maelstrom. Sensing her friend's peril, Bob began instinctively whistling an ancient tune taught to her years ago as a hatchling by her grandmother. A shimmer of blinding light momentarily blazed forth from her shell. The Magical Talking Turtle dug her claws into the deck before turtlepulting herself towards where she last saw Uncle Matt. Just before he hit the water, Bob intercepted his fall, having seized a rope hanging free from the bow. Matt clung to her shell while they swung in a wide arc until Bob let go, launching them both back onto the tilting deck with an epic quadruple backflip.

Righting himself, Matt saw Bob had also snatched up the harpoon gun from the stern during her acrobatics. Taking aim as Matt shielded her from falling debris, she speared a harpoon straight through the kraken's left eye in a spray of viscous ichor, its unearthly wails shaking even the soul of the ocean itself. Surrendering with a final furious thrash, it released the battered ship and sank into lightless depths. A ragged cheer went up from the surviving crew and weary travelers. Though the ship was severely damaged, the main mast yet stood. As if burrowing into the halls of the Fabled Adventure Realm Terrapin Tailweavers, they had defeated the oceanic terror against all odds.

After the storm passed and repairs were underway, Matt and Bob met with Captain Runa to plan the next leg of their journey. Though busy directing her crew, she paused a moment to give the pair a gap-toothed grin. "Never saw anything like that in over 600 years at sea!After that legendary display, If you are that determined to find this lost city, I'll get you there if I have to strap the ship to my back, and swim y'all myself!"

A fortnight later, a shimmering glow could be seen on the horizon. Bob's Magical Talking Turtle perception flared with recognition. She was adamant this was the destination they had been seeking out since boarding the Emerald Gannet. They bade the crew farewell and good luck, promising they would try their hardest to have their collective destinies entwine again at a later date.

Bob pulled out her traveling mouth harp and twanged an upbeat and happy little ditty. At the conclusion of the song, a good 10 minutes later, she tapped Matt on the shoulder with a proud smirk along with a bright spark and a pop. This was a song Uncle Matt knew well—the Song of the Pond. He would have no problem accompanying his friend on a journey under the sea, just as they had on many past adventures.

The travelers slipped overboard before dusk, plunging into the midnight sea with the last rays of sunlight quickly fading as they dove deep into the oceanic abyss. Propelling themselves downward through leagues of shadow, they were guided only by intuition and faith that this mythical place awaited discovery. As their limbs began to cramp and burn with exhaustion, a haunting vista emerged from the gloom far below—a glowing domed city of coral, gold, and mother of pearl. Its impossible beauty transfixed them. By some quirk of magic or nature, the fantastical metropolis remained preserved despite the crushing pressures.

They quickened their pace, racing toward arched gates standing open in silent invitation. Passing through the entranceway, Matt and Bob swam into a soaring chamber lined with statues of manta rays and sharks. Sitting upon huge throne-like shells encrusted with barnacles were three ancient, wizened turtles adorned with kelp beards and tattered seaweed robes.

"You have finally arrived, Uncle Matt and Bob The Magical Talking Turtle," spoke the central turtle in a resonant, watery voice. "I am Emeritus, high sage of the Triumvirate. My fellow masters here are Antiquus, venerable keeper of our collected knowledge, and Vaticus, who scans the tangled currents of fates yet to come."

Matt and Bob bowed low, awestruck to be addressing such revered beings. "Please, honorable sages," said Bob respectfully. "A force of insidious darkness infests our world above. Can you provide any wisdom or aid to help us restore balance across the realms?"

The ancient three turtles shared grave nods, their eyes heavy with sorrow. "Alas, the foul shadow you speak of cascades through all seas and spheres," Antiquus declared, his voice raspy with age. "But shards of light remain scattered amid the murk that may yet illuminate a clear path ahead."

Slowly raising one weathered flipper, Antiquus summoned forth an ornate scepter glowing with opalescent radiance. It slowly drifted down into Bob's unexpecting hands. "For you, the Star-Song Scepter," he intoned, wispy brows knitted with importance. "With it, channel arcane insights from realms beyond imagining."

Bob's face lit up as she studied the scepter, tracing its intricate runes. Matt looked on proudly as she gave it an experimental twirl, pleased to see his friend receive such a gift.

Then Vaticus lifted his gaze and a glittering sword haloed in argent flame manifested from thin water. "The Dimension Blade," Vaticus pronounced with a sharp tone, levitating the blade over to Matt. "With it, cleave seams between worlds, and glimpse fates unseen."

Matt accepted the sword, amazed to find it felt perfectly balanced, seeming to hum at his touch.

Lastly, Emeritus floated over a small ornate box carved from abalone shell with circular motifs in mother of pearl. "The Melody Box," he said. "It channels the very rhythm underlying creation, yet prolonged exposure overwhelms the mortal mind." The box emitted a symphony of mellifluous tones. "Go now and redeem what was made corrupt through ignorance and fear. But temper justice with love, or all may still sink into the abyss."

Overwhelmed with gratitude for such kingly gifts, Matt and Bob profusely thanked the sagely turtles before kicking upwards through prismatic waters toward the sun-kissed surface, ready to take on the battles ahead. As they rose swiftly through the ocean, all fatigue washed away, replaced with swelling hope and renewed courage. Breaking the water's surface, Bob's scepter began to glow. A faint beam shot out pointing to the south, piercing the night's moonless darkness. After a moment, their eyes adjusted to its radiant beam, providing a guiding path toward a lagoon sheltered by imposing mountains, far larger than they had seen in a very long time. Peril possibly awaited above, but now destiny's path stretched clearly before them, as their journey was only just beginning.
