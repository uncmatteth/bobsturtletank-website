Chapter 1: Go Explore!

The morning sun crested over the distant Iron Mountains, scattering golden rays of light across the remote village of Cedar Hollow, stirring Uncle Matt from slumber. He awoke with a gleeful sparkle in his eye, eager to seize the possibilities that this new day would bring. While the villagers that he has called friends for so long, were content with their predictable daily routines of farming, weaving, and trading, Matt felt the restless longing for adventure calling powerfully in his soul once more.

After consuming a hearty breakfast to properly fuel his plans, Matt regaled the village children with an epic tale of a courageous knight and a mischievous dragon. The children sat gasping and cheering as he vividly described the clashing of sword against claws, fiery blasts of dragon breath, and the daring acts of courage and cleverness undertaken by the knight to vanquish his foe. The amused parents appreciated Matt's gift for imagination and optimism, which never failed to excite life in their remote village.

As the thrilled youngsters scampered off to their morning chores, Matt decided this day would finally mark the start of the long-awaited journey he had dreamed of for so long. Firmly believing that wonder and discovery lay just past the western valley, he briskly packed supplies including cheese, bread, dried venison, and a vial of honey. After donning his feathered cap and cloak, Matt reverently lifted his father's silver lute from its resting place, checking the strings were still perfectly tuned before slinging it over his shoulder.

He took one last look around his cozy cottage, making sure it was tidy, with everything in its proper place. He smiled broadly to himself, because the effort didn't really matter anyway. This would probably be the last time he set his sights on all the memories he's made hereâ€¦

He pinned a note to the door that read: "My friends. I am blessed to have been so warmly welcomed into Cedar Hollow so long ago. I built this simple home with the help of many wonderful individuals that I have grown to consider family. Though, now I must bid farewell to attend to pressing matters elsewhere. I unfortunately do not know when, or if I will be returning, so I leave my house and belongings to all of you, to be used to benefit the community. If and when the time comes, I am sure there will be plenty of help to build a new place to hang my lute." -Your favorite Uncle -Matt.

He then stepped outside, leaving the door open and unlocked, setting off without a backwards glance humming a traveling tune to the wind.

Walking along the stony village path through Cedar Hollow that led out into the countryside, Matt paused several times, intentionally imprinting memories of the place he called home for the past twenty summers. He etched in his mind images of the thatched cottages with thin trails of smoke drifting lazily from their brick chimneys. The fine leather goods on display outside the tanner's shop crafted into belts and boots, bearing testament to the creator's renowned skills. Lively sounds filling the bustling market square each morning as traders hawked fresh produce, smoked meats and spun wool. A touch of wistfulness tempered Matt's palpable excitement, knowing he would miss the familiar comforts of hearth and kin after this day. But the siren's call of adventure echoed too strongly in his heart to ignore, and Matt knew fate beckoned him onward to realms unknown beyond the sheltering mountains encircling Cedar Hollow.

The winding village path quickly led Matt into the tranquil Willow Woods where playful sunlight danced overhead guiding the way with joy. Birds trilled merrily in the treetops, carrying news of fine weather while hungry fledglings chirped demands from nests tucked into boughs. Squirrels chattered gossip and rumors in clicks and squeaks, while ceaselessly hunting acorns and seeds as they scampered through the brush.

With a carefree spirit, embarking upon his grand quest, Matt whistled happily along the shaded forest trail, deftly picking out notes to match the melodies pulsating through the environment. He paused occasionally to sing silly songs for the amusement of skittish creatures peeking out from shadowed hiding spots, letting creativity flow into lyrical nonsense rhymes inspired by his charming surroundings.

As the sheltering canopy of the dense woods gradually opened up into the sun-kissed grasses of Morning Meadows, Matt felt the quickening of his step and a sense of purpose guiding his stride. He was now farther from Cedar Hollow than he had ventured in a very long time. The terrain that spread out before him was becoming less familiar, but Matt embraced it with a sense of anticipation rather than apprehension.

Upon reaching the top of the ridge line late that afternoon, he caught sight of thin wispy plumes of cook fire smoke drifting lazily upward from a sheltered dell nestled below. Hoping to perhaps meet a fellow wanderer with intriguing tales to share over supper, Matt picked his way carefully down the gently sloping hillside covered in heather and dots of wildflowers toward the source of the smoke. Following the trail led him right to a small campsite, with traveling supplies strewn haphazardly around it.

Beside the merrily babbling brook, Matt discovered a most perplexed looking turtle sporting a shimmering emerald shell with a tinge of red behind her ears, who presently was rummaging intently through the contents of an overturned rucksack, all while muttering to herself in frustration.

"Hello there my dear friend! It looks like our journeys' have become intertwined once again! I've so very much missed you!" Matt called out warmly, immediately recognizing Bob the Magical Talking Turtle, and delighted over this serendipitous reunion.

"Uncle Matt! This is such a delightful and entirely unexpected surprise" Bob exclaimed with evident relief in her voice, as she abandoned the task of repacking her spilled belongings and quickly ambled over to greet her oldest friend. She went on to explain that while ranging much farther than normal from her quiet pond home this time of the season, she had stumbled into an ancient hedge maze that seemed to shift its paths inexplicably and without pattern. Poor Bob had become completely lost for hours in the labyrinth before finally locating an exit that dropped her rather unceremoniously, into this unfamiliar dell.

Matt could not help but smile broadly in that moment, intuitively knowing that their crossing paths was a clear sign from the fates themselves that adventure awaits. He kindly helped Bob repack her travel rucksack properly, and in return she gifted him a pouch of wild brambleberries she had picked just that very morning.

The two friends chatted amiably well into the evening over a humble supper of brook trout and foraged wild onions. As the stars gradually winked into view one by one from between the sheltering limbs overhead, Matt and Bob talked late into the night, excitedly discussing dreams of what surprises and discoveries lay just waiting to be found over the next rise. It was certain to be a journey neither would ever forget!

The morning sun sent beams of light filtering through the forest. A chorus of birdsong greeted Bob and Matt as they broke camp, efficiently packing up their gear after a quick breakfast. They set out in high spirits, continuing their journey down the winding dirt road that cut through the woods. Even though they had only begun the day before, the two friends felt emboldened by their progress made so far on the trek.

Around midday, after miles of walking, lively singing, and conversation, Bob and Matt reached the top of a wooded ridge. Pausing to admire, they took in the vista of meadows and forests stretching below. Their pleasant reverie was only broken by a gruff shout just ahead, where the road passed over a wide stone bridge spanning a deep rocky ravine.

"You'll be paying the toll to cross my bridge!" bellowed a troll blocking their path. An enormous beast, nearly eight feet tall with warty green skin and a bulbous nose leaned lazily on a wooden club, scratching its protruding belly with its free hand.

Bob took in the troll's muttonheaded gaze with amusement showing no fear. "And what if we choose not to pay this toll of yours?" she asked lightly. The troll blinked stupidly, then scowled, baring sharp crooked yellow teeth. "Then you don't cross the bridge!" it grunted. "And if you try, I'll bash you good!" the troll said as it slammed its club down for emphasis.

Bob chuckled heartily, "Let's not be too hasty now!"

Reaching for his worn leather case, Matt pulled out his lute and without another word he began strumming a cheerful, rhyming tune.

The troll's brutish face scrunched in confusion at the sudden music. It scratched its head, listening to the nonsensical lyrics about the woods and the road. For several verses it stood perplexed, unable to make sense of why Matt was singing silly songs instead of paying the toll. Its befuddlement was understandable, as it was a seemingly common occurrence amongst those that happen to cross paths with Uncle Matt in their travels.

As the song continued, the troll's eyelids drooped. The cheery melody acted like a lullaby, causing the beast's head to nod sleepily. Matt played on, watching as the troll swayed to the hypnotic tune. At last, the huge bulk of the troll toppled to the ground with a resounding crash, immediately beginning to snore loudly. Matt ended his playing with a flourish, and then slung the lute over his shoulder, grinning widely to Bob.

"Well that's one way to handle the troll's toll," Bob said laughing, shaking her head in amazement at the absurd simplicity of putting the troll to sleep. The two travelers quickly hurried across the unguarded bridge leaving the snoring heap behind.

Once safely on the other side, Matt played a quick victory song to celebrate outwitting the beast. "That's the magic of music!" he declared cheerily.

Bob smiled broadly at his clever trick for dealing with the obstacle, and with the sleeping troll soon left far behind, the two friends continued down the forest road in renewed high spirits after the day's small adventure.

As they continued along the winding forest road, Bob began to faintly hear what sounded like pitiful whimpers emanating from a dark crevasse carved into the looming hillside. With her Magical Talking Turtle hearing being far superior to the average humans', pointing towards an outcropping, Bob said in a hushed tone, "Uncle Matt! Wait a moment!! Do you hear that sound?!"

They cautiously ventured into the murky darkness. There they discovered a small cave inhabited by an injured baby griffin, crying mournfully for its absent mother, its wing seemingly badly broken.

With great care, Matt gingerly cleaned and splinted the damaged wing using strips of cloth torn from his pack. Meanwhile, Bob soothed the griffin, her melodic voice echoing comfortingly through the cave as she sang a gentle lullaby. "There, there little one. You're safe now," she murmured soothingly. Her dulcet tones soon quieted the orphaned creature's cries and steadied its breathing as it slipped into peaceful slumber.

Come morning, golden sunlight streamed into the cave as the mother griffin returned. She eyed the two humans quizzically as they recounted finding and helping her wounded offspring. "We only wished to ease his pain until your arrival," Matt explained softly.

Seeing the splint upon her child's wing, gratitude suffused the mother's gaze. She addressed Matt and Bob solemnly, "Noble emissaries, you have shown great compassion aiding my vulnerable child in his time of need." She presented Matt with a radiant crystal on a gilded chain. "Please accept this gift as a humble token of thanks."

"The treasure you now bear conceals wondrous power; its light can pierce the blackest night. In times of despair, its radiance shall renew your faded strength and courage. When evil arises, it will banish the shadows, revealing the righteous path."

Ancient wisdom flashed in her eyes as she continued gravely, "Trust in its guidance small ones. But, wield its power judiciously, and with care. For it will only fully unveil itself to those pure of heart."

Matt bowed reverently while receiving the gift. He could feel the crystal's mystical energy flowing through it. And, after farewells, he and Bob continued their forest journey, the crystal glinting in the sunlight yielding them a reminder of the compassion and friendship found that day. Though they did not yet grasp its full purpose, they understood it was a token of the bond formed between kindred spirits.

The friends marched on as the sun sank behind the distant Iron Mountains. Before long, they happened upon a merchant's wagon that had tipped onto its side in a muddy ravine. Quickly assessing the situation, they combined their strength and skills to free the trapped wheels from the muck and right the unfortunate wagon. Grateful, the merchant rewarded their kindness with a bag of tantalizingly fragrant honey candies. He then showed them a little known shortcut that would save them a few days' travel, before bidding them a good day, and continuing on his way.

As dusk began blanketing the sky, Matt and Bob arrived at the edge of the shadowed Dragon Wood. For generations, the ancient forest had an unsettling reputation across the land for mysteriously devouring unwary travelers who dare enter its darkness. Numerous chilling local rumors had centered on the Dragon Woods' sinister curse cast long ago, placed there when an arrogant king plundered sacred groves secluded within its depths. But, the alluring promise of uncovering secrets untouched for centuries in the woods emboldened the friends despite the dangers.

Wisdom cautioned them towards settling in for the night rather than entering the ominous forest. However, restraint had never been Matt's forte. The thrilling exhilaration singing in his veins simply would not allow waiting until dawn. Raising the illuminating crystal gifted by the griffin in the air, it cast a strong guiding light piercing the gloomy darkness below the trees. "Bob! This is what we have sought after! I'm sure the beginning of our true adventure lies within these trees," he confidently declared.

With those bold words, Matt eagerly plunged into the unknown depths of the Dragon Wood. Bob shook her head, chuckling to herself in wry amusement at her friend's expected reckless enthusiasm, yet she too felt the inexorable pull of mystery and discovery emanating from the ancient forestâ€¦ Gripping her walking stick firmly, the Magical Talking Turtle followed her best friend Uncle Matt resolutely into the shadows.

As they slowly walked along the faint forest path, weak shafts of light filtered down sparsely through the dense canopy of leaves above. Matt occasionally paused to mark trees along the way with small sigils using a piece of chalk hoping to avoid traveling in maddening circles within the vast woods. Wolven howls were heard echoing in the distance, although no visible threat emerged to confront the companions directly. Gradually, the deepening twilight leached away what little daylight remained, leaving Bob and Matt surrounded by a blanket of pitch darkness barely kept at bay by the illumination from the crystal held aloft.

Bob gently advised Matt, "We should make camp soon. I know you are eager to press onward, but we both need proper rest before braving the full depths of this cursed forest."

Matt sighed in resignation, but nodded begrudgingly in agreement, realizing as always that Bob's counsel was wise and true. They gathered dry fallen branches and made a small campfire in the shelter of a moonlit clearing just off the path.

As the crackling flames banished the darkness, Matt brought out his lute and coaxed a soothing melody from the strings. The familiar tunes were a boon to their frazzled nerves after the eeriness of the strange forest.

With their bellies now full, eyelids soon grew heavy for both. Bob volunteered to take the first sleep shift, trusting that Matt would follow her example when the time came later to switch places. But, rest did not find our Uncle easily.

Lying on his bedroll, staring upward at the stars peeking through small gaps in the canopy, Matt's thoughts churned with exhilaration over the incredible events of the day now drawing to a close. How he had waited for this moment to finally take those first real steps along this path he had thought about for so long? Each accomplishment so far was but a small taste of the greater glories still lying ahead. With his trusted companion Bob now beside him, what feats might they go on to achieve together? What other monstrous beasts might they have to face with their combined gifts of music and magic?

Across the flickering fire, Bob emitted an exasperated huff at her friend's stubborn resistance to slumber. "You need proper rest for the challenges of tomorrow, not your usual song writing this night," chiding Matt gently.

As Matt's gaze drifted to the softly glowing crystal resting atop his satchel, he wondered what greater secrets it might yet hold... Could there be more to its power than mere illuminating light?... With such might on their side would evil itself soon tremble, and flee their righteous presence? Matt's wandering thoughts soon blended hazily with the smoke still drifting up from the campfire as he finally slipped into a deep slumber. But, one last passing thought rose haphazardly to the surface before dreams fully claimed himâ€¦ Perhaps he might even find true love on this journey, and thus never feel the need to return to Cedar Hollow's comforting but lonely isolation ever againâ€¦

When the slim crescent moon reached its apex over the towering trees, signaling the late hour, Bob woke Matt gently to exchange places for the night watch. Though quite reluctant to leave his glorious dreams of future triumph Matt quickly shook off slumber's grip as he knew even Bob's magical turtle endurance had limits. Once Bob was settled comfortably, Matt added a bit more tinder to the flickering fire watching intently as the renewed flames steadily consumed the dry wood.

Confident the fire would last several hours, Matt settled against his bedroll. Next to him, propped against his pack was his silver lute. His gaze then fell once more upon the gently glowing crystal next to him. Ideas for lyrics exploring its mythic origins began creeping into his mind. Taking up the instrument, he softly began strumming a whimsical tune about an ancient lost city hidden deep within a magical forest, much like this one, improvising into the early hours of the morning.

Days of travel later. Subtle signs gradually emerged indicating that the legendary power of the Dragon Wood was more than mere myth and rumor. At first, the evidence was easy to dismiss. A massive gnarled tree root crossing the path seemed to shift slightly when Matt glanced away. Glimpses of darting shadows flitted at the edge of his vision when no living thing was near. Whispers in an unknown language were just barely audible above the sound of snapping twigs under foot.

When Bob inquired about Matt's agitated glances back over his shoulder, he hesitated before responding. Reluctant to voice superstitious fears based on irrational imagination. Bob had always been the skeptical one, mistrustful of anything lacking sound explanation. Not him. There was likely some ordinary justification for the odd occurrences.

Matt attempted to casually shrug it off and blamed his escalating apprehension on the gloomy surroundings playing tricks on his mind. But, the disquieting sense of being watched refused to abate as they ventured ever deeper under the endless trees.

Later that afternoon, Matt could not completely contain his relief when the path ended abruptly at the rocky bank of a swiftly flowing stream cutting through the woods. Consulting their map revealed no indication of a water crossing along their route. Perhaps the obstruction had formed naturally sometime in the intervening years since its creation. They agreed to make camp early on the near side to discuss options for safely traversing this new obstacle.

Building a makeshift raft would be highly time consuming, and swimming across was an extremely risky proposition given the strong muddy current churning through the gorge below. As Matt prepared a fire, Bob methodically walked upstream, carefully studying the gushing water's far side, her expression hopeful. After some time, she returned triumphantly to report spotting a massive, moss-covered fallen tree, spanning the entire width a good distance away. Its colossal trunk would easily provide safe passage over the water.

In the morning they quickly found the perfect crossing point discovered the previous night. Though the other side of the bank was steep, Bob was able to claw her way up the crumbling edge with only minor difficulty and confirm the path did continue onward as expected to a small village a short distance off their chosen route. The stream still churned angrily far below, but the broad tree trunk bridge allowed easy passage across the gorge. By Matt's estimation, after a short detour for supplies, one more full day's travel should finally bring them out of the Dragon Wood's eastern boundary. His mood soared at leaving the oppressive trees behind and getting his first glimpse of the lands beyond.

Meanwhile, unseen by either friend, a silent figure hid motionless upstream amidst the dense foliage closely watching their movements. After they crossed the water and moved on, it crept to the bank's edge and glared at the fallen tree bridge with smoldering hatred. The bizarre creature then retrieved a shard of glistening crystal on a cord around its neck. Breaking off a sliver and shaking its fist at the sun, the creature then tossed it into the churning waters below. As if in direct response, the stream began greedily carving away at the mud and loose rocks around the bridge's base. By sunset, when Matt and Bob returned to cross back over, jubilant at almost having finally reached the Dragon Wood's border, the fallen tree had collapsed into the ravenous currents. Their easy way back eastward was gone!

That night, Matt struggled to maintain enthusiasm around their small campfire. Insidious doubt had begun creeping into his mind's corners. The bridge's sudden destruction right after their crossing reeked of more than mere happenstance, and whatever mysterious forces dwelt in this wood, had clearly not taken kindly to their temporary presenceâ€¦

Across the flickering flames, Bob sensed her friend's uncharacteristic moodiness. But, she chose not to press him for explanations in this moment. She knew there would be time enough tomorrow, once they were finally free of the oppressive trees for Matt to share his full thoughts when some perspective had returned. For tonight, she lightened his spirits by humorously recounting her misadventures after getting lost in the enchanted hedge maze days earlier. Matt managed a wry smile at her vivid descriptions, his mood lifting slightly for the moment, unaware that at dawn's first light, revelations awaited them both.

The next morning's sunshine pouring brightly through the breaks in the forest canopy lifted their spirits. After days spent mired in the Dragon Wood's perpetual gloom, cresting the rise ahead together, an awe-inspiring vista opened up before them of vast plains rippling to the far horizon. The windswept grasses shifted hypnotically when brisk gusts raked down from the imposing mountains in the distance. One glance confirmed they had managed to arrive somewhere of great significance; a corner of the world untouched with pristine emanating beauty and potential.

Filled with renewed purpose, Matt and Bob began their descent onto the beckoning plains where they felt the true heart of their quest awaited discovery. However, crossing those last few yards out of the Dragon Wood's bounds proved no simple matterâ€¦

The crystalline shard concealed by the creature detected the companions' proximity to escape, and warned its master poised to attack and halt their flight.

The instant they passed beneath the arches of final trees and triumphantly stepped out into the open grassland beyond, the ground itself erupted violently. A writhing mass of thick gnarled roots burst upward without warning, flinging Matt and Bob forcibly in opposite directions.

Landing roughly on his back, the air was knocked from Matt's lungs. Before he could rise or catch his breath, animated roots were already slithering towards him like grotesque serpents. They wrapped tightly around his arms and legs with crushing force, pinning his limbs painfully to the hard ground.

Through eyes blurred by dirt, Matt glimpsed Bob helplessly bound tight against the trunk of a nearby oak, thick vines encircling her throat and chest. They constricted around her each time she struggled to take a breath, or sing out notes of power that could free them both from this botanical trap. She pulled fiercely at them, but that only caused them to tighten their hold.

The pulsing crystal around Matt's neck sensed their desperation; and that a glimmer of opportunity was beckoning. Just as the tree's roots tightened their grip, preparing to crush Matt's bones, radiant light burst forth suddenly from the crystal, banishing the darkness created by the servant creatures' crystalline shard. Intense beams of pure white light shot outward burning the tangled roots, causing them to shudder in agony against the onslaught of light slackening its grip on Matt momentarily.

Stumbling to his feet, dazed but freed from the loosened roots, Uncle Matt raised the glimmering crystal high above his head, willing the light to intensify further. It built to a crescendo, streaming brighter and brighter, as he slowly approached the ancient tree demon. The gnarled roots recoiled in fear, shriveling away from Matt's wrath, empowered by the crystal. The tree attempted retreating by shrinking its thick trunk back into the soil, but the light pursued relentlessly. Within moments, only a blackened smoldering crater remained where the massive tree had once stood.

Bob slipped free of the now crumbling vines binding her to the oak tree. Joining Matt, she added her voice in perfect harmony to the blinding melody of power emanating from the crystal. Together, their voices dissolved every last foul root of the demon, finally ending the arduous battle.

Sheathing it safely away until truly needed once more, Matt quietly slipped the now darkened crystal back under his shirt, disturbed, yet awed by its formidable capabilities. Perhaps, the artifact is still too mysterious to fully comprehend, yet. With a solemn understanding, the friends knew such formidable power must not be called upon again until wisdom dawned to truly guide them.

Matt and Bob continued onward in thoughtful silence toward their awaiting adventures. At that moment, the friends were unaware that their journey was only just beginning!
