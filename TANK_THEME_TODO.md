## ❌ NEEDS TANK THEME (Still using generic Card components)

### High Priority (Most Visited)
1. `/about` - Generic cards, needs underwater theme
2. `/book` (main) - Generic cards, needs treasure chest theme
3. `/book/characters` - Generic cards, needs tank residents theme
4. `/book/artifacts` - Generic cards, needs sunken treasure theme
5. `/book/locations` - Generic cards, needs tank zones theme
6. `/book/trivia` - Generic styling, needs tank quiz theme

### Medium Priority
7. `/book/buy` - Generic styling
8. `/book/characters/[slug]` - Individual character pages

### Lore Pages (All need consistent underwater theme)
9. `/lore` (main) - Generic cards
10. `/lore/connections` - Generic cards  
11. `/lore/guardians` - Generic cards
12. `/lore/magic` - Generic cards
13. `/lore/realms` - Generic cards
14. `/lore/timeline` - Generic cards

### Game Pages
15. `/games/bounce` - Needs review
16. `/games/roguelike` - Needs review
17. `/games/leaderboard` - Partially themed

## What Needs To Be Done

### Tank Theme CSS Classes to Apply:
- `underwater-card` - For card backgrounds
- `tank-title` - For headings
- `treasure-chest` - For book/content containers
- `underwater-arcade` - For game sections
- Tank-appropriate color gradients

### Consistency Requirements:
1. All cards should have underwater/tank styling
2. All headings should use `tank-title` class
3. Color schemes should match tank theme (blues, greens, purples)
4. Bubble animations where appropriate
5. Consistent bob-speaking callout boxes

## Next Steps:
1. Apply tank theme to `/about` (high traffic)
2. Apply tank theme to `/book` main page (central hub)
3. Apply tank theme to all `/book/*` subpages
4. Apply tank theme to all `/lore/*` pages
5. Review and fix any remaining game pages
6. Final consistency pass on all pages
7. Commit and deploy
