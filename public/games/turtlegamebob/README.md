# 🐢 Bob's Roguelike - Fresh Start with BrowserQuest Assets

## What Happened Here

**OLD APPROACH (DELETED):**
- 15+ "complete" HTML game files
- Over 17,000 lines of over-engineered code
- Multiple ECS implementations
- Phaser 3 setup that never worked right
- PixelLab AI-generated sprites that were broken

**NEW APPROACH (CURRENT):**
- **Fresh start with proven assets**
- 888 high-quality sprites from BrowserQuest reskin
- All Bob animations already done (idle, walk, attack, jump, etc.)
- Ready to build a simple, working roguelike

## Next Steps

1. **Review Sprites** (CURRENT STEP)
   - Open sprite viewer
   - Decide what to keep/trash
   - Identify any missing sprite types

2. **Build Simple Roguelike**
   - Use these proven BrowserQuest assets
   - Start with basic movement (Bob walks in 4 directions)
   - Add simple combat
   - Procedural dungeon generation
   - Turn-based or real-time combat?

3. **Keep It Simple**
   - No over-engineering
   - No "enterprise-grade" ECS
   - Just a fun, working roguelike game
   - Canvas or Phaser? (Phaser might be easier with these sprite sheets)

## Why BrowserQuest Assets Are Perfect

1. **Already proven** - They worked in a real game
2. **Complete animations** - Bob has all 4-directional animations
3. **Consistent style** - All pixel art matches
4. **Battle-tested** - No broken AI-generated weirdness
5. **888 sprites** - More than enough for a full roguelike
6. **7.4MB total** - Lightweight and fast
