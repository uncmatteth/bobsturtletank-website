Chapter 2: The Goblin Ambush!

As dawn's first faint glow crept over the craggy Misty Mountain peaks, soft golden light gently enveloped the remote mountain pass where they had made camp. Matt awoke from a light slumber to see the rising sun slowly reveal the breathtaking vistas surrounding their campsite. For two days now, since escaping the eerie Dragon Woods, he, and his oldest friend Bob The Magical Talking Turtle had gazed upon the sprawling grassland plains stretching before them. Uncle Matt could scarcely contain his eagerness to explore this new realm and wondered what adventures awaited on the open plains. Would there be more fantastic beasts to battle?! What ancient magical spells and secrets could there be to uncover?! His imagination conjured endless possibilities, which seemed to be a fairly frequent occurrence.

After a quick breakfast nothing remained but to strike out once more into the great unknown. Consulting their worn, tattered map, the two companions set off down through the steep and treacherous pass. The barren stones soon gave way to swaying grasses as far as the eye could see, an untamed land devoid of roads and villages. Their excitement grew with each passing hour spent beneath the wide open sky, far from the confines of trees and familiar routines.

When the bright sun finally dipped below the western hills at day's end, they made camp beside a winding stream. Bob began working to stoke up a small fire, and Matt brought out his lute, strumming a lighthearted, cheerful melody about life on the open road. Unimpeded by muffling trees, the music echoed brightly over the vast plains.

Twilight slowly faded into inky blackness, and the night sky lit up with brilliant, dazzling stars now unveiled by the village lights. Their travels had already carried them very far from the safety and comfort of Cedar Hollow.

The next two days passed without incident. Matt spent the time weaving fanciful, melodic tales to entertain them, imagining ancient ruins and exotic creatures around each bend as they walked. Indulging his nonsense with amusement, The Magical Talking Turtle was always prepared to temper Matt's enthusiasm when it grew impractical, but for now, she was enjoying his silly traveling stories.

Late the third afternoon, storm clouds ominously built behind them, and Bob examined the darkening sky with concern, judging they only had mere hours before the tempest overtook them. If fortune granted them shelter, they had to find it quickly before the arrival of torrential rains.

Upon reaching the top of a small rise, a rocky outcropping spotted with caves became visible in the distance, offering hope of shelter, but, reaching them would be risky. Still, the pair raced down into the valley toward them. As they drew tantalizingly near, sharp howls suddenly echoed from the black mouths of the caves. Squinting revealed dozens of tiny humanoid shapes swarming out from the shadowed tunnels.

Charging straight towards them was a pack of goblins, each uglier than the last. Some were mounted on snarling wolves, while others brandished crude axes and blades of stone. In moments, they found themselves surrounded.

Matt quickly drew his short sword, cursing himself for leaving his enchanted crystal secured in his travel pack. Its radiant magic would have been a formidable weapon against these shadow-born beasts. Bob gripped her oaken staff tightly, ready to fight, but staying mindful that the raging storm could break at any moment. The largest goblin, doubtless the pack leader, leered down from his fearsome mount with rotten teeth bared.

"You dare trespass in our lands, Manling and Shelled Snack?! Now you pay, or die!"

The circle of goblins bellowed in anticipation and moved closer, cutting off any chance of escape. Matt and Bob exchanged a quick nod. It would have to be a fight!!

With a blood-curdling battle cry, Matt fiercely swung his blade at the nearest wolf-riding goblin, lopping off the creature's gnarled arm before it could strike. Black blood sprayed as the goblin fell howling. Taking her turn, Bob shouted a ringing note that reverberated painfully in her opponents' sensitive ears, sending several reeling back.

The furious clash quickly descended into chaos. Matt slashed and stabbed relentlessly at any goblin within reach, while Bob bludgeoned creatures upside the head when they ventured too near. For several desperate minutes, the beleaguered pair somehow managed to fend off the relentless assault. The goblin's numbers barely seemed diminished as Matt's limbs grew increasingly weary. He knew they could not sustain this pace much longer.

Just as hope began fading, a blinding flash split the sky as the storm finally broke over head. Heavy raindrops pelted down, hissing where they struck the shrieking goblins' skin. Seizing the distraction, Bob shouted an ear-splitting note, amplified by her turtle magic, and empowered by the torrent. While the pack cowered in pain, Matt swept the enchanted crystal from his pack and thrust it skyward unleashing its powerful light, just as he had against the living tree demon days earlier.

The unprepared goblins had no defense against the crystal's pure radiance. They howled in agony, clawing at their burning skin. Matt and Bob struck with reinvigorated fury, decimating the pack. By the time the crystal's potency faded, only charred goblin corpses remained. The rain washed the blood and filth away, eerie silence settling over the valley. Uncle Matt sheathed his gore-spattered sword, amazed to have survived the vicious ambush. Overwhelmed, Bob simply sat staring into the distance, numb and unsure of what to do next. After some time, she finally stood, still in shock but knowing they needed to press on. As the storm passed, a bold rainbow soon arced over the scene of their victory, granting an image of hope after so much shadow. Weary and battered, the companions took heart from the rainbow's vivid colors, gathering their resolve to continue the long journey ahead.

This victory finally allowed them a short rest, and with the threat gone they discussed their concerns about the intelligent tactics displayed by the normally mindless goblins. Some controlling force must have guided them, possibly connected to the living tree entity guarding the Dragon Woods. It was troubling that an unknown enemy seemed to dog their steps. Nevertheless, the bard forced the thought from his mind as he tended to Bob's minor wounds. They had triumphed and lived! That was enough for now.

By unspoken consent, they passed a silent, contemplative night in the bloody valley, rather than seeking a new campsite. Neither felt capable of further travel after the vicious fight.

Volunteering for first watch, Matt knew sleep would elude him as adrenaline still pounded through his veins. He stared for hours into the small fire, replaying each terrifying moment in obsessive detail. Their skill and bravery had seen them through, yes; but, fortune had intervened on their behalf twice now. How long could such luck last? What fell powers hunted them; and could they ever hope to stand against that ancient malice if it found them unprepared?

At dawn's first light, Matt was startled from his brooding by Bob's gentle tap on his shoulder. He had not noticed the night's darkness fading into the pale glow of morning. Smiling sheepishly, he roused himself to help her prepare a cold breakfast. They were both too weary for cooking, signaling that it was time to move on. Their victory had earned them another day of life and freedom. Though where this path led, none could say.

It was not Matt's destiny to hide from uncertainty. However, keeping the enchanted crystal close rather than packed away might be wise for now. Taking only this sole precaution, the traveling pair again turned their faces toward the ever-nearing mountains leaving the bedeviled valley of rains behind.

After these harrowing trials, broader reflection was needed on the forces seemingly aligned against their quest. But, reckoning was not for this day.

The winding stream they followed emerged from a gaping gorge that gashed through the mountains like a monstrous ax stroke from the gods. According to the map, these were the fearsome Giant's Teeth, aptly named for their sheer granite faces and jagged, snow-capped peaks. Approaching them filled Matt with awe and dread in equal measure. What could be awaiting up there watching their passage from those dizzying heights?

The terrain grew increasingly harsh as they descended into the gorge. A once lazy stream now sliced a treacherous channel through jumbled boulders and sudden ravines. Movement slowed to a weary crawl as they scrambled over endless rocky obstacles. After grueling days spent in sight of the ever-looming mountains, the promise of traveling to new vistas had unfortunately started to lose its luster for Uncle Matt!

Late on the fourth day with the sun sinking low, they reached a relatively flat ledge suitable for camping, sheltered on one side by a sheer rock wall and the churning river on the other. Bone-weary, the pair wanted nothing more than to collapse into sleep, but caution prompted Matt to inspect their potential shelter first after the earlier goblin ambush!

The rock face was embedded with numerous small openings, most no larger around than his head. Toward the southern end, he located a low cave, about ten paces deep and half as wide. Its sandy floor showed no tracks, so he felt satisfied it was unoccupied. With the last golden light rapidly fading, he and his turtle friend wasted no time rolling out their bedrolls on the cave floor, and building a small fire at its mouth. Soon, they were hungrily devouring a dinner of dried rabbit and thankfully drifting off to sleep beneath the twinkling stars.

A few hours later, Matt awoke with a start, instantly knowing something was wrong. Their fire had died to embers leaving the gorge enveloped in shadow. The moon hung low behind the mountains, providing exiguous light. Straining his senses against the quiet backdrop of the river's flow, he felt an unnatural silence hanging over their campsite. Normally ever present, not even the incessant buzzing of insects could be heard.

He quickly roused a bleary Bob, who also sensed the disturbance in their surroundings. They kept still, not daring to show awareness until determining the threat. Matt's hand slowly crept toward his sheathed sword. His breath caught when faint shuffling sounds emanated from the darkness outside of their shelter. Something had discovered them while they slept, cutting off the route of escape. He turned to silently acknowledge Bob's signal towards the cave entrance, as a bulky, misshapen form blotted out the faint shine of the moon.

Triangular yellow eyes smoldered to life, reflecting the dim firelight. A face like chiseled granite glared at them, with tusks protruding up from the lower jaw. The hulking creature ducked low and crept into the cave on all fours. Matt could make out its thick, stony hide and a massive club clutched in one clawed hand. There could be only one thing stalking them in these mountains. With a deafening roar, the giant lunged with the force of a hurricane. Swinging its massive club toward Matt's head, he frantically rolled aside as the weapon smashed into the ground where he had lain just a moment before. In one smooth motion, he ripped his sword from its sheath and slashed a long gash down the giant's meaty forearm. Black blood spurted as the giant bellowed in rage and swung again, forcing him to dive clear once more.

From the darkness behind them, Bob let out a piercing note that momentarily dazed their foe. Seizing the opening, Matt hacked viciously at the giant's leg while it was staggering from the musical attack. The short sword's blade bit deep but seemed incapable of severing the thick muscle and bone. The giant quickly recovered and kicked out with surprising speed, its heavy foot catching Matt's side and flinging him hard against the cave wall. Crumpling to the ground, he desperately fought to stay conscious through the pain.

The towering monster turned toward the now defenseless Bob, murder shining in its cruel eyes. But right before it could strike, a blinding light filled the cave! Bob had dashed to Matt's side and grasped the enchanted crystal, unleashing its power at point-blank range into the giant's face. The otherworldly radiance seared eyes usually only accustomed to darkness. The giant reeled away, clasping its hands across its head, and crashing into the cave walls in agony.

Seeing their chance, Bob hoisted Matt to his feet and half-dragged him toward freedom. He stumbled along as quickly as his battered body allowed. Behind them, the frenzied giant was already recovering despite its smoldering vision. Its enraged roars promised murder if it caught them again.

Somehow, the battered pair escaped into the night and a short way down the ledge path to where they had camped. Matt could go no further. He slumped against the cliff face, fighting unconsciousness. Bob stood over him protectively, crystal in hand, but they both knew it was only a matter of time. The giant thundered out of the cave in pursuit, blinded, but guided by scent and sound. This seemed like it could be the end for the dynamic duo. Victory was within grasp of the terrible beast!

In that moment of despair, a deep, powerful voice bellowed out from the blackness further down the ledge. "Your fight is not yet finished, brave ones! This realm still has need of you!"

A warm, golden light blossomed, revealing a tall, robed figure, holding a legendarily massive oaken staff. The injured giant paused in confusion at this new threat, giving the mysterious figure time to strike the stone beneath its feet. Glowing veins of crackling lightning exploded, splitting the ledge where it struck.

Uttering a desperate, final, enraged roar, the giant tumbled into the darkness as the stone gave way. A distant splash announced the creature's end upon the churning river rocks far below.

Turning to regard Matt and Bob, the robed figure spoke in a gentle voice. "Relax your brow and rest easy, my friends.You are safe!When you wake, we shall talk more of the destiny that led us all to this place." And with those cryptic words, he waved a hand over the companions and they sank gratefully into profound slumber.

Matt awoke slowly, blinking against the morning sunlight filtering into the cave. For a moment, he thought the giant attack must have been a nightmare. But, the lingering pain in his ribs and other body parts argued otherwise. Matt gingerly sat up, surprised to find his wounds expertly bandaged. Bob lay nearby, still sleeping peacefully.

A strong breeze suddenly rushed into the cave opening, knocking the giant's club over the cliff's edge. The force of it splintering against the rock face sent ripples of sound through the otherwise still morning. Frazzled by the unwelcome surprise, the events of the previous night flooded back, filling his mind. A robed stranger had saved them from certain death at the hands of the giant. But who was this mysterious savior, and where had he gone? Moving as cautiously, and silently as he could, Matt ventured to the cave entrance exhaling in relief when no gargantuan monster awaited outside. Their equipment remained undisturbed. The ledge path showed no fragments from the collapsed section that had defeated their foe. Impossibly all seemed normal despite their close brush with death. As Matt rummaged for food, Bob finally stirred, similarly confused to find herself alive, and tended to after the savage fight. But of their enigmatic rescuer, there was no sign.

Before they could wonder long at his absence, the tall, antlered figure appeared further down the ledge, approaching with the aid of his walking staff. Stooped with great age, his deeply lined face and long white beard bespoke decades, perhaps centuries of life. Yet, his eyes were still bright and keen beneath the gnarled brow.

"Greetings young travelers," he said in a rich resonant voice. "I trust you have recovered from your ordeal."

Matt inclined his head respectfully. "Thanks to you sir! We would not have survived without your intervention. You have our deepest gratitude."

The elder nodded gravely, his wise eyes meeting theirs. "I am called Everwood. For countless years I have been tasked with watching over these ancient mountains seeking to guide and assist those who journey here with courage and noble purpose." His piercing gaze turned to Matt, who shivered slightly.

"Dark forces move against the good in this world. The minions of the evil sorcerer Zarak have grown bold indeed if they assault wanderers through the landscape so openly. You have an important part to play in coming events, Uncle Matt of Cedar Hollow and Bob, of the Red-Eared Slider Clan. Tread thoughtfully on your journey, and have faith in your inner strength."

Matt trembled, a cold unease creeping through him. How did this stranger know his name and the village he had called home for so long? Even more puzzling, was that Bob hails from a very distant, and very infrequently visited corner of the Adventure Realm. Rarely, if ever in her journeys has she come across anyone who had heard of her magical kin. What role could they possibly play against mythical figures of evil like the sorcerer Zarak?

Sensing Matt's trepidation, Everwood gave a gentle, reassuring smile. "Do not be afraid my child. Your companion's wisdom shall light your way forward. Have faith in one another and the undiscovered gifts granted you both. When the need is greatest, my aid shall always be available to you. All will unfold as fate decrees."

The enigmatic figure then took several steps back down the rocky ledge. "Our paths shall converge again. For now, go forth on yours. Much ground still remains before you reach journey's end."

With those final arcane words, Everwood then tapped his carved staff twice upon the stony earth.An explosive flash of blinding light forced Matt and Bob to shield their eyes. When they could see again, the elder fey had vanished.

The companions gazed at one another in awe. Everwood seemed an ally of immense power and foresight. Matt's earlier fears began to recede, knowing they had gained a wise mentor, against the looming darkness that stalked their quest.

Bolstered by this newfound hope, Matt and Bob gathered up their gear and set off once more toward the beckoning mountains, and whatever mysteries lay beyond.

After braving the treacherous Giant's Teeth, uncovering an enchanted crystal of light, and now securing a powerful new guide, the two walked with building eagerness.

True, their path still held many perils ahead, but wonders and revelations awaited as well, for their journey was only just beginning!
